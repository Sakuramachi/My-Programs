My interest in IT
My interest in information technology revolves mostly around space exploration and space industries. Since the emergence of successfuly operating private space corporations, such as Space Ex, my attention focused towards the use of IT in that field and how we can use IT to further broaden and make possible our access to space. In addition to the new IT technologies that would be devloped from such endeavours.
I also have an interest in the emergency of 'General AI', and the usage of machine learning to make better our automated systems, both in industry and personal everyday use. 
My background in IT so far has mostly been in working with and developing IP based devices and systems within the security industry.
